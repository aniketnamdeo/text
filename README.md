Before buying furniture for your bedroom, you need to decide some factors like wall colour, or bedroom wallpaper, and the type of flooring that you want. Try to choose a colour that will help you create a calm atmosphere and also compliment well with your bedroom furniture. The lighting needs to be chosen wisely as well because a very bright bedroom is not soothing enough, whereas a room with insufficient lighting will hinder activities such as bedtime reading. Accessories add the perfect finishing touch to bedroom designs. For example, soft furnishings add comfort, style and colour whereas beautiful cashmere throws are luxurious and warm. Scented candles add a nice touch and woven baskets provide storage and work well with natural, rustic and eclectic styles. You can also use wallpaper to work with the size and shape of your room, for example, striped wallpaper can make walls look taller, or rooms appear wider, which is particularly good for small rooms.
